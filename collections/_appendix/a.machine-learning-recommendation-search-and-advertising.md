# English

Machine learning engineering is the work of building software systems that learn from data and make predictions, rankings, classifications, or recommendations. It is not only about training a model in a notebook. In real companies, the model is only one part of the system. The work also includes data pipelines, feature generation, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, retraining, latency control, and explaining why the system behaves the way it does.

This field includes several important product areas. Recommendation systems decide which videos, posts, products, songs, jobs, or courses a user may want to see. Search systems decide which results are most relevant to a query. Advertising systems decide which ad to show, to whom, at what price, and under what constraints. Risk systems estimate fraud, credit risk, abuse, spam, or suspicious behavior. Forecasting systems predict demand, inventory, traffic, churn, or cost.

The common thread is this: the system must make many decisions repeatedly, using data, under real business constraints. A machine learning engineer helps build those decision systems.

### How the field developed

Machine learning began as a research area, but it became an engineering field when companies started using models inside products. A model trained for a paper can be evaluated once and reported. A model used in production must keep working every day, with new users, changing data, unexpected behavior, broken pipelines, and business pressure.

Early production machine learning often used simpler models: logistic regression, decision trees, gradient-boosted trees, matrix factorization, and linear ranking models. These models were attractive because they were easier to train, explain, deploy, and debug. Many business systems still use them because they are fast, stable, and good enough for many problems.

The internet changed the scale. Search engines, e-commerce platforms, social networks, video platforms, ad networks, and app stores produced enormous behavioral data. The question was no longer only “can we predict this label?” It became “can we rank millions of items for millions of users, update the system constantly, test changes safely, and measure long-term effects?” This is where recommendation, search, and ads became some of the most important industrial machine learning areas.

Deep learning expanded what models could do. Neural networks became dominant in computer vision, speech recognition, language modeling, translation, recommendation, and many ranking tasks. But deep learning also made engineering harder. Large models require more data, more compute, more monitoring, and more careful evaluation. They can improve quality, but they also introduce cost, latency, interpretability, and reliability problems.

The current stage is shaped by foundation models and generative AI. Many teams now use large language models, embedding models, multimodal models, and retrieval systems as components inside larger products. At the same time, traditional ML systems have not disappeared. Recommendation, search, advertising, fraud detection, pricing, and forecasting still rely heavily on structured data, ranking systems, online experiments, and production pipelines. McKinsey’s 2025 global AI survey reports that AI use is now widespread across organizations, but many companies are still early in scaling it and capturing enterprise-level value. 

### How the industry works

Machine learning engineering looks different depending on the business.

In large technology companies, ML systems are usually part of major product infrastructure. Recommendation teams work on feeds, videos, shopping suggestions, music discovery, or job matching. Search teams work on retrieval, ranking, query understanding, indexing, and relevance. Ads teams work on targeting, bidding, conversion prediction, budget pacing, auctions, and measurement. These teams usually have ML engineers, data engineers, backend engineers, product managers, data scientists, research scientists, platform engineers, and analysts working together.

In smaller companies, machine learning engineers often do more general work. One person may collect data, train a model, build an API, deploy it, monitor it, and explain results to product teams. The advantage is broad ownership. The risk is weak production practice. A model may work in a notebook but fail once it receives messy real inputs, slow requests, missing features, or changing user behavior.

In AI-first startups, ML engineers may work close to product development. They may fine-tune models, build evaluation datasets, improve retrieval, reduce inference cost, or adapt models to a specific domain. These companies often move fast, but the risk is that model quality may be confused with product value. A technically impressive model is not enough if users do not trust it, need it, or fit it into their workflow.

In traditional enterprises, ML work is often tied to forecasting, fraud, churn, pricing, operations, maintenance, risk, customer segmentation, and decision support. The data is often messy, old, regulated, or spread across systems. The hardest part may not be model training. It may be data access, business ownership, compliance, deployment, and getting people to trust or use the result.

In platform teams, ML engineers build infrastructure for other ML teams: feature stores, model registries, training pipelines, experiment tracking, deployment systems, monitoring, evaluation platforms, and inference services. This work is less visible to end users but extremely important. Without shared infrastructure, every model team repeats the same mistakes.

### What different roles contribute

A **machine learning engineer** builds models and the systems around them. This may include data preparation, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and retraining. A weak ML engineer only trains a model. A strong ML engineer understands the entire path from raw data to production behavior.

A **recommendation engineer** builds systems that decide what users should see next. This role may work on candidate generation, ranking, personalization, diversity, freshness, exploration, cold-start problems, and feedback loops. The work is not simply “predict what the user likes.” A recommendation system must balance user satisfaction, business goals, content quality, fairness, repetition, novelty, and long-term retention.

A **search engineer** builds systems that help users find relevant information. This may involve indexing, query understanding, retrieval, ranking, filters, spelling correction, semantic search, personalization, and evaluation. Search quality depends on both engineering and judgment. A result can be technically relevant but still not useful to the user.

An **ads machine learning engineer** builds models for ad ranking, click prediction, conversion prediction, bidding, budget pacing, fraud detection, and measurement. Ads systems are technically demanding because they operate under high traffic, strict latency limits, auction rules, business constraints, and constant feedback from advertiser behavior. This area can be lucrative, but it also raises ethical questions because optimization can conflict with user experience.

A **ranking engineer** works on ordering items: search results, feed posts, products, ads, recommendations, or messages. Ranking is common across many products. It involves features, labels, loss functions, evaluation metrics, online experiments, and tradeoffs between competing goals.

A **MLOps engineer** focuses on the production lifecycle of machine learning. This includes training pipelines, model versioning, reproducibility, deployment, monitoring, alerting, data drift detection, feature stores, and rollback. MLOps exists because models are not ordinary static code. They depend on data distributions that change.

A **feature platform engineer** builds shared systems for generating, storing, serving, and monitoring features. In many ML systems, features are as important as model architecture. If online features differ from training features, the model may behave badly. Feature infrastructure helps keep training and production consistent.

A **model deployment or inference engineer** focuses on serving models efficiently. This role works on latency, throughput, batching, caching, quantization, model compression, hardware utilization, autoscaling, and reliability. It is especially important when models are large or traffic is high.

A **data scientist** may overlap with ML engineering, but the emphasis is often different. Data scientists may explore data, build models, run experiments, and communicate findings. BLS describes data scientists as workers who collect, clean, analyze, and model data, including creating, validating, testing, and updating algorithms and models.  In production-heavy teams, the line between data scientist and ML engineer can be blurry; in research-heavy or analytics-heavy teams, it may be clearer.

A **research scientist** works closer to new methods, model architectures, training approaches, or theoretical questions. This role often requires advanced graduate training and a publication record. It is different from most ML engineering roles, which focus more on making models work inside products.

### What practitioners need to become good at

The first ability is understanding the problem before choosing the model. Many beginners start by asking which algorithm to use. Professional work starts earlier: What decision is the system making? What data is available? What is the label? What mistakes are costly? How will success be measured? How will the model be used? A simple model solving the right problem is better than a complex model solving the wrong one.

The second ability is data judgment. Machine learning systems learn from data, so bad data becomes bad behavior. A model can fail because labels are noisy, features leak future information, training data differs from production data, important groups are underrepresented, or the target metric rewards the wrong behavior. Data issues are often harder than model issues.

The third ability is evaluation. Offline accuracy is not enough. A recommendation model may improve click-through rate but increase low-quality content. A search ranking model may improve average relevance but fail on rare queries. An ads model may improve short-term revenue but damage user trust. ML engineers need to design offline metrics, online experiments, guardrail metrics, slice analysis, and failure analysis.

The fourth ability is production engineering. A model must run within latency and cost constraints. It must handle missing features, bad inputs, service failures, version changes, and traffic spikes. It must be monitored after deployment. A model that is accurate but too slow, too expensive, or too fragile may not be usable.

The fifth ability is experiment thinking. Many ML changes cannot be judged only offline. Teams need A/B tests, holdouts, phased rollouts, and careful interpretation. Experiments can be misleading when sample sizes are too small, metrics are noisy, users interfere with one another, or short-term effects differ from long-term effects. Recommendation and ads systems are especially vulnerable to feedback loops.

The sixth ability is understanding feedback loops. Once a model changes what users see, it also changes the data collected later. A recommendation system that shows more of one type of content will collect more feedback on that content. A fraud model that blocks certain behavior changes what fraud data is observed. These loops can reinforce bias, reduce exploration, or hide failure.

The seventh ability is collaboration with product and business teams. ML systems often optimize measurable targets, but not every measurable target is the right goal. Engineers must understand why the model exists, who is affected, what the business wants, and what failure would mean. Without this, ML work can become metric chasing.

The eighth ability is humility about model behavior. Models are statistical systems, not proof machines. They can behave well in aggregate and fail badly in particular cases. They can improve one metric while harming another. Strong ML engineers are comfortable investigating failure rather than defending the model.

### Employment outlook and risks

The demand picture is strong, but the field is not easy to enter. BLS projects employment for data scientists to grow 34% from 2024 to 2034, with about 23,400 openings per year, and lists a bachelor’s degree as typical entry-level education while noting that some employers require or prefer a master’s or doctoral degree.  Many ML engineering roles sit near this data science category, but production ML roles often require stronger software engineering than the title “data scientist” suggests.

The broader software market also supports this field. BLS projects software developers, QA analysts, and testers to grow 15% from 2024 to 2034, and states that demand will be supported by continued expansion of software development for AI, IoT, robotics, and automation.  ML engineering is therefore pulled from both sides: data-driven modeling and production software.

However, entry-level ML is highly competitive. Many learners can train models on public datasets. Fewer can build reliable data pipelines, evaluate failure cases, deploy models, monitor drift, design experiments, or explain tradeoffs. A portfolio made only of notebook models is weak. A stronger portfolio shows a complete system: data collection, cleaning, baseline model, evaluation, API deployment, monitoring, error analysis, and a clear explanation of limitations.

The field is also stratified. Research scientist roles and frontier model training roles are concentrated in a smaller number of well-funded companies and labs. They often require advanced degrees, strong publications, or exceptional engineering experience. Applied ML roles are broader and exist across many industries, but they may use less glamorous models. A fraud model, churn model, demand forecast, or ranking model may be more employable than an impressive but impractical deep learning demo.

AI tools will affect the work, but they will not remove the need for ML engineers. AI can help write training code, draft feature transformations, generate evaluation scripts, explain errors, and summarize papers. But it cannot decide whether the data is biased, whether the metric is wrong, whether the model is causing a harmful feedback loop, or whether the online experiment is misleading. Stack Overflow’s 2025 survey shows that AI tool use among developers is widespread, but trust remains limited; more developers distrust AI accuracy than trust it, and only a small fraction highly trust AI output.  In ML engineering, this skepticism is necessary.

The long-term defensible path is not “knowing the latest model.” Models change quickly. The durable skills are problem framing, data judgment, evaluation, production engineering, experiment design, and the ability to connect model behavior to product behavior. The people most exposed are those who only know how to run training scripts. The people most valuable are those who can make ML systems work responsibly in production.

机器学习工程，是构建能够从数据中学习，并做出预测、排序、分类或推荐的软件系统的工作。它不只是关于在 notebook 中训练一个模型。在真实公司里，模型只是系统的一部分。这项工作还包括数据流水线、特征生成、评估、部署、监控、重新训练、延迟控制，以及解释系统为什么会这样表现。

这个领域包括几个重要的产品区域。推荐系统决定用户可能想看到哪些视频、帖子、产品、歌曲、工作或课程。搜索系统决定哪些结果与查询最相关。广告系统决定向谁展示哪条广告，以什么价格展示，并在什么约束下展示。风险系统估计欺诈、信用风险、滥用、垃圾信息或可疑行为。预测系统预测需求、库存、流量、流失或成本。

共同点是：系统必须在真实业务约束下，使用数据，反复做出大量决策。机器学习工程师帮助构建这些决策系统。

### 这个领域是如何发展起来的

机器学习最初是一个研究领域，但当公司开始把模型放进产品中使用时，它变成了一个工程领域。一篇论文中的模型可以被评估一次并写进报告。一个用于生产环境的模型，则必须每天持续工作，面对新用户、变化的数据、意外行为、损坏的流水线和业务压力。

早期生产级机器学习常使用更简单的模型：逻辑回归、决策树、梯度提升树、矩阵分解和线性排序模型。这些模型有吸引力，因为它们更容易训练、解释、部署和调试。许多业务系统现在仍然使用它们，因为它们快速、稳定，并且对许多问题来说已经足够好。

互联网改变了规模。搜索引擎、电商平台、社交网络、视频平台、广告网络和应用商店产生了巨量行为数据。问题不再只是“我们能否预测这个标签？”而变成了“我们能否为数百万用户排序数百万个项目，不断更新系统，安全地测试变化，并衡量长期影响？”这正是推荐、搜索和广告成为最重要的工业机器学习领域之一的地方。

深度学习扩展了模型能力。神经网络在计算机视觉、语音识别、语言建模、翻译、推荐和许多排序任务中变得占主导地位。但深度学习也让工程变得更困难。大型模型需要更多数据、更多算力、更多监控和更谨慎的评估。它们可以提升质量，但也引入成本、延迟、可解释性和可靠性问题。

当前阶段受到基础模型和生成式 AI 的塑造。许多团队现在把大语言模型、嵌入模型、多模态模型和检索系统作为更大产品中的组件。同时，传统机器学习系统并没有消失。推荐、搜索、广告、欺诈检测、定价和预测，仍然高度依赖结构化数据、排序系统、在线实验和生产流水线。麦肯锡 2025 年全球 AI 调查报告称，AI 使用已经在组织中广泛存在，但许多公司在规模化和获取企业级价值方面仍处于早期阶段。

### 这个行业如何运作

机器学习工程会因业务不同而呈现不同形态。

在大型科技公司中，ML 系统通常是主要产品基础设施的一部分。推荐团队处理信息流、视频、购物推荐、音乐发现或职位匹配。搜索团队处理检索、排序、查询理解、索引和相关性。广告团队处理定向、出价、转化预测、预算节奏、拍卖和效果测量。这些团队通常由 ML 工程师、数据工程师、后端工程师、产品经理、数据科学家、研究科学家、平台工程师和分析师共同合作。

在较小公司中，机器学习工程师通常承担更通用的工作。一个人可能负责收集数据、训练模型、构建 API、部署模型、监控模型，并向产品团队解释结果。优势是拥有广泛所有权。风险是生产实践薄弱。一个模型可能在 notebook 中有效，但一旦遇到混乱的真实输入、缓慢请求、缺失特征或变化的用户行为，就会失败。

在 AI-first 创业公司中，ML 工程师可能更接近产品开发。他们可能微调模型、构建评估数据集、改进检索、降低推理成本，或把模型适配到特定领域。这些公司通常行动很快，但风险在于把模型质量误认为产品价值。一个技术上令人印象深刻的模型，如果用户不信任、不需要，或无法把它放进工作流中，就仍然不够。

在传统企业中，ML 工作通常与预测、欺诈、流失、定价、运营、维护、风险、客户分群和决策支持绑定。数据常常混乱、陈旧、受监管，或分散在不同系统中。最难的部分可能不是模型训练，而是数据访问、业务所有权、合规、部署，以及让人们信任或使用结果。

在平台团队中，ML 工程师为其他 ML 团队构建基础设施：特征存储、模型注册表、训练流水线、实验追踪、部署系统、监控、评估平台和推理服务。这项工作对最终用户不那么可见，但极其重要。如果没有共享基础设施，每个模型团队都会重复同样的错误。

### 不同角色分别贡献什么

**机器学习工程师**构建模型及其周围系统。这可能包括数据准备、特征工程、模型训练、评估、部署、监控和重新训练。薄弱的 ML 工程师只会训练模型。强的 ML 工程师理解从原始数据到生产行为的完整路径。

**推荐工程师**构建决定用户接下来应该看到什么的系统。这个角色可能处理候选生成、排序、个性化、多样性、新鲜度、探索、冷启动问题和反馈循环。这项工作并不只是“预测用户喜欢什么”。推荐系统必须平衡用户满意度、业务目标、内容质量、公平性、重复性、新颖性和长期留存。

**搜索工程师**构建帮助用户找到相关信息的系统。这可能涉及索引、查询理解、检索、排序、过滤、拼写纠错、语义搜索、个性化和评估。搜索质量同时依赖工程和判断。一个结果在技术上可能相关，但对用户仍然没有用。

**广告机器学习工程师**构建用于广告排序、点击预测、转化预测、出价、预算节奏、欺诈检测和效果测量的模型。广告系统技术要求很高，因为它们运行在高流量、严格延迟限制、拍卖规则、业务约束和来自广告主行为的持续反馈之下。这个领域可能收入较高，但也会引发伦理问题，因为优化目标可能与用户体验冲突。

**排序工程师**处理项目排序：搜索结果、信息流帖子、产品、广告、推荐或消息。排序在许多产品中都很常见。它涉及特征、标签、损失函数、评估指标、在线实验，以及多个竞争目标之间的取舍。

**MLOps 工程师**关注机器学习的生产生命周期。这包括训练流水线、模型版本管理、可复现性、部署、监控、警报、数据漂移检测、特征存储和回滚。MLOps 之所以存在，是因为模型不是普通静态代码。它们依赖会变化的数据分布。

**特征平台工程师**构建用于生成、存储、服务和监控特征的共享系统。在许多 ML 系统中，特征和模型架构同样重要。如果线上特征与训练特征不同，模型可能表现很糟。特征基础设施帮助训练和生产保持一致。

**模型部署或推理工程师**专注于高效地服务模型。这个角色处理延迟、吞吐量、批处理、缓存、量化、模型压缩、硬件利用率、自动扩缩容和可靠性。当模型很大或流量很高时，这个角色尤其重要。

**数据科学家**可能与 ML 工程重叠，但重点通常不同。数据科学家可能探索数据、构建模型、运行实验，并传达发现。美国劳工统计局将数据科学家描述为收集、清洗、分析和建模数据的工作人员，其中包括创建、验证、测试和更新算法与模型。在生产导向团队中，数据科学家和 ML 工程师之间的界线可能很模糊；在研究导向或分析导向团队中，这条界线可能更清楚。

**研究科学家**更接近新方法、模型架构、训练方法或理论问题。这个角色通常要求高级研究生训练和论文发表记录。它不同于大多数 ML 工程角色，后者更关注让模型在产品中工作。

### 从业者需要变得擅长什么

第一项能力是在选择模型之前理解问题。许多初学者一开始就问应该使用哪种算法。专业工作开始得更早：这个系统要做出什么决策？有哪些数据可用？标签是什么？哪些错误代价高？成功如何衡量？模型将如何被使用？一个解决正确问题的简单模型，优于一个解决错误问题的复杂模型。

第二项能力是数据判断。机器学习系统从数据中学习，所以坏数据会变成坏行为。模型可能因为标签有噪声、特征泄露未来信息、训练数据不同于生产数据、重要群体代表不足，或目标指标奖励了错误行为而失败。数据问题往往比模型问题更难。

第三项能力是评估。离线准确率不够。推荐模型可能提升点击率，但增加低质量内容。搜索排序模型可能提升平均相关性，却在罕见查询上失败。广告模型可能提升短期收入，却损害用户信任。ML 工程师需要设计离线指标、在线实验、护栏指标、分片分析和失败分析。

第四项能力是生产工程。模型必须在延迟和成本约束内运行。它必须处理缺失特征、坏输入、服务失败、版本变化和流量激增。部署后必须被监控。一个准确但太慢、太贵或太脆弱的模型，可能无法使用。

第五项能力是实验思维。许多 ML 变化不能只靠离线结果判断。团队需要 A/B 测试、保留组、分阶段发布和谨慎解释。当样本量太小、指标噪声过大、用户彼此干扰，或短期效果不同于长期效果时，实验可能具有误导性。推荐和广告系统尤其容易受到反馈循环影响。

第六项能力是理解反馈循环。一旦模型改变用户看到的内容，它也会改变之后收集到的数据。一个推荐系统如果展示更多某类内容，就会收集到更多关于该类内容的反馈。一个欺诈模型如果阻止某些行为，就会改变被观察到的欺诈数据。这些循环可能强化偏差、减少探索，或隐藏失败。

第七项能力是与产品和业务团队合作。ML 系统通常优化可衡量目标，但并不是每个可衡量目标都是正确目标。工程师必须理解模型为什么存在，谁会受到影响，业务想要什么，以及失败意味着什么。否则，ML 工作可能变成追逐指标。

第八项能力是对模型行为保持谦逊。模型是统计系统，不是证明机器。它们可以在总体上表现良好，却在具体案例中严重失败。它们可以改善一个指标，同时损害另一个指标。强的 ML 工程师愿意调查失败，而不是为模型辩护。

### 就业前景与风险

需求图景较强，但这个领域并不容易进入。美国劳工统计局预计，2024 至 2034 年，数据科学家就业将增长 34%，每年约有 23,400 个职位空缺，并将学士学位列为典型入门学历，同时指出一些雇主要求或偏好硕士或博士学位。许多 ML 工程角色接近数据科学这一类别，但生产型 ML 角色通常比“数据科学家”这个标题暗示的更需要软件工程能力。

更广泛的软件市场也支撑这个领域。美国劳工统计局预计，2024 至 2034 年，软件开发者、QA 分析师和测试人员就业将增长 15%，并表示 AI、IoT、机器人和自动化软件开发的持续扩张会支撑需求。因此，ML 工程受到两侧拉动：数据驱动建模和生产级软件。

然而，入门级 ML 竞争非常激烈。许多学习者可以在公开数据集上训练模型。更少的人能构建可靠数据流水线、评估失败案例、部署模型、监控漂移、设计实验或解释取舍。只由 notebook 模型组成的作品集很弱。更强的作品集展示完整系统：数据收集、清洗、基线模型、评估、API 部署、监控、错误分析，以及对限制的清楚说明。

这个领域也有分层。研究科学家岗位和前沿模型训练岗位集中在少数资金充足的公司和实验室中。它们通常要求高级学位、强论文成果或异常突出的工程经验。应用型 ML 岗位更广泛，存在于许多行业，但可能使用不那么光鲜的模型。一个欺诈模型、流失模型、需求预测模型或排序模型，可能比一个令人印象深刻但不实用的深度学习演示更有就业价值。

AI 工具会影响这项工作，但不会消除对 ML 工程师的需求。AI 可以帮助编写训练代码、起草特征转换、生成评估脚本、解释错误和总结论文。但它不能决定数据是否有偏，指标是否错误，模型是否造成有害反馈循环，或在线实验是否具有误导性。Stack Overflow 2025 年调查显示，开发者对 AI 工具的使用已经很广泛，但信任仍然有限；不信任 AI 准确性的开发者多于信任者，只有很小比例高度信任 AI 输出。在 ML 工程中，这种怀疑是必要的。

长期具备防御性的路径，不是“知道最新模型”。模型变化很快。持久技能是问题界定、数据判断、评估、生产工程、实验设计，以及把模型行为与产品行为连接起来的能力。最容易受到冲击的人，是那些只知道如何运行训练脚本的人。最有价值的人，是那些能让 ML 系统负责任地在生产中运行的人。
