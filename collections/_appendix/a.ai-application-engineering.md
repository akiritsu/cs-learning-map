AI application development is the work of turning AI models into usable products. The main task is not to invent a new model from scratch. It is to take existing models, data, tools, interfaces, and workflows, and combine them into something people can actually use.

A simple AI demo may answer a question in a chat box. A real AI application must do more. It has to know what data it is allowed to use, when to search, when to call a tool, how to handle wrong answers, how to protect private information, how to show uncertainty, how to measure quality, how to control cost, and how to fit into a real work process.

This field sits between software engineering, product design, data engineering, machine learning, and business operations. It is one of the most accessible AI-related fields for software developers, but it is also easy to misunderstand. The hard part is not making a model produce text. The hard part is making an AI system useful, reliable, safe, and worth maintaining.

### How the field developed

Before large language models became widely available, most AI products required specialized machine learning work. A team often had to collect data, train a model, evaluate it, deploy it, and maintain it. This was expensive and slow. AI appeared in recommendation systems, search ranking, fraud detection, image recognition, speech recognition, translation, and enterprise prediction systems, but building these systems usually required dedicated ML expertise.

The release of powerful general-purpose language models changed the entry point. Developers could call an API and immediately build tools for summarization, question answering, drafting, code assistance, data extraction, translation, customer support, search, and workflow automation. This made AI application development look similar to ordinary software development: call a model, connect it to a database, build an interface, deploy it.

That first wave created many demos, but it also revealed the real problems. Models hallucinate. They may answer confidently with wrong information. They may ignore instructions. They may leak sensitive data if poorly designed. They may become expensive under heavy use. They may perform well in examples but fail on edge cases. They may work for one user but not for a team with permissions, audit requirements, and compliance rules.

The next stage was retrieval-augmented generation, usually called RAG. Instead of asking the model to answer only from its internal memory, the application retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and gives them to the model as context. This made enterprise AI applications more plausible: companies could connect models to manuals, policies, tickets, contracts, reports, product documentation, or customer records. But RAG did not remove the hard parts. Search quality, chunking, permissions, document freshness, citation accuracy, evaluation, and user trust all became engineering problems.

The current stage is agentic AI and workflow integration. In these systems, the model may call tools, plan steps, search databases, write code, update records, open tickets, or interact with other software. McKinsey’s 2025 global AI survey reports that nearly nine out of ten respondents say their organizations regularly use AI, and 62% say their organizations are at least experimenting with AI agents; however, nearly two-thirds have not yet begun scaling AI across the enterprise. The same survey emphasizes that redesigning workflows is a key factor in capturing value from AI. This is the central reality of the field: AI adoption is widespread, but making it work at organizational scale is still difficult.

### How the industry works

AI application work appears in several kinds of organizations.

In startups, AI applications are often the product itself. A startup may build an AI customer support tool, legal research assistant, coding agent, sales assistant, writing tool, meeting assistant, data analysis assistant, recruiting tool, design tool, or industry-specific workflow product. These companies move quickly and rely heavily on APIs, open-source models, vector databases, prompt design, evaluation scripts, and rapid product iteration. The risk is that many products are easy to copy if they are only a thin layer over a model. Durable value usually comes from workflow depth, proprietary data access, distribution, trust, integrations, or a specialized user base.

In large technology companies, AI application teams often build features inside existing products. Search, office software, developer tools, cloud platforms, customer support systems, analytics tools, CRM products, and design software are all adding AI features. These teams must integrate AI into mature systems with existing users, permissions, performance expectations, reliability standards, and business models. The work is less glamorous than a demo, but more realistic: AI has to coexist with old code, old data, and old user habits.

In traditional enterprises, AI application work often begins with internal productivity use cases: knowledge search, document summarization, customer service assistance, contract review, report drafting, internal help desks, compliance support, and workflow automation. The main obstacles are rarely just model quality. They are data access, privacy, security, employee adoption, approval processes, integration with old systems, and unclear ownership. A tool may work technically but fail organizationally if it does not match how people actually work.

In consulting and solution-provider companies, teams build AI applications for clients. This work may involve proof-of-concept demos, internal copilots, RAG systems, data preparation, workflow automation, model selection, governance, and deployment. The advantage is exposure to different industries. The risk is shallow implementation: a client may want a quick AI demo without solving the deeper data and workflow problems that determine whether the system will last.

In AI platform companies, the work is closer to infrastructure. Teams build tools for model hosting, prompt management, evaluation, observability, vector search, guardrails, monitoring, fine-tuning, agent orchestration, and cost control. These products serve other AI builders. This part of the field requires stronger engineering depth because the customers are technical teams with production problems.

### What different roles contribute

An **AI application developer** builds user-facing AI features. This may include chat interfaces, document assistants, summarizers, workflow tools, extraction systems, recommendation helpers, or internal copilots. The value of this role is turning a model into a product that handles real inputs, real users, errors, latency, permissions, and cost.

An **LLM application engineer** works more specifically with large language models. This role designs prompts, tool calls, structured outputs, retrieval flows, memory, model routing, and fallback behavior. A weak LLM application engineer only writes prompts. A strong one understands failure modes: hallucination, context loss, irrelevant retrieval, prompt injection, malformed output, cost spikes, and evaluation gaps.

A **RAG engineer** builds systems that combine search and generation. This role works with document ingestion, chunking, embeddings, vector databases, reranking, metadata filters, permissions, citation handling, and answer evaluation. The value is not “connect documents to a chatbot.” The value is making the system retrieve the right evidence, refuse when evidence is weak, and respect who is allowed to see what.

An **AI product engineer** works across product and engineering. This role asks whether AI should be used at all, where it fits into the user journey, what users should see, what control they need, what mistakes are tolerable, and how success should be measured. A good AI product engineer knows that not every workflow should become a chatbot.

An **AI evaluation engineer** designs ways to measure whether an AI system is working. This may involve test sets, human review, automated scoring, regression tests, adversarial examples, quality rubrics, latency tracking, cost metrics, and production monitoring. This role is becoming more important because AI systems do not have simple pass/fail behavior. They may be correct, partially correct, misleading, unsafe, or useful despite imperfections.

An **AI workflow engineer** integrates AI into business processes. This may include connecting models to ticketing systems, CRMs, document stores, data warehouses, code repositories, email, calendars, internal tools, or approval flows. The role requires understanding both software integration and how people actually work. Many AI projects fail because they are impressive in isolation but awkward inside the real workflow.

An **AI platform engineer** builds shared infrastructure for AI teams. This may include model gateways, authentication, logging, prompt versioning, evaluation pipelines, observability, cost controls, deployment systems, and governance tools. This role is common in organizations that have many AI use cases and need common foundations rather than one-off prototypes.

A **prompt engineer** as a standalone role is less stable than the name suggests. Prompting is a real skill, but most companies are unlikely to build long-term teams around prompt writing alone. The durable version of this role is broader: someone who understands models, product behavior, evaluation, structured output, tool use, retrieval, and user workflows.

A **domain AI specialist** combines AI application skills with knowledge of a specific field, such as law, medicine, finance, education, logistics, customer support, software development, or scientific research. This role matters because AI systems often fail when builders do not understand the work they are trying to assist. Domain knowledge helps define good answers, unacceptable errors, and useful workflows.

### What practitioners need to become good at

The first ability is software delivery. AI applications are still software. They need interfaces, APIs, databases, authentication, logging, testing, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. A person who can only call a model API cannot build a serious AI product. The application around the model often determines whether the system is useful.

The second ability is understanding model limits. Models can sound correct while being wrong. They can follow instructions in one case and fail in another. They can struggle with long context, hidden assumptions, rare facts, arithmetic, citations, tool use, or ambiguous user requests. A good AI application developer does not treat model output as truth. They design systems that check, constrain, retrieve, verify, or escalate.

The third ability is evaluation. This is one of the most important skills in the field. AI systems are difficult to improve if no one can measure quality. Developers need to create test cases, compare model versions, track failures, measure retrieval quality, check hallucinations, monitor user satisfaction, and decide what level of error is acceptable. Without evaluation, teams are only guessing.

The fourth ability is data and retrieval judgment. Many AI applications depend on company documents, knowledge bases, tickets, code, policies, or customer records. If the data is outdated, duplicated, badly formatted, poorly chunked, or permissioned incorrectly, the AI system will be unreliable. The model may receive the wrong context and produce a polished wrong answer. RAG work is often more about data quality and search than about prompting.

The fifth ability is product judgment. A good AI feature gives users control. It should make clear what it can do, what it used as evidence, when it is uncertain, and how the user can correct it. Many bad AI products fail because they ask users to trust too much. Better products keep humans in the loop where consequences matter.

The sixth ability is security and privacy awareness. AI applications often connect to sensitive data and tools. A careless design can expose private documents, let users access information they should not see, or allow prompt injection to manipulate tool calls. Developers need to think about permissions, data retention, logging, secrets, user identity, audit trails, and abuse cases from the beginning.

The seventh ability is cost and latency control. AI calls are not free, and slow responses damage product experience. Developers need to understand token usage, caching, model selection, batching, streaming, fallback models, rate limits, and when a smaller or cheaper model is enough. A demo can ignore cost; a production product cannot.

The eighth ability is workflow understanding. AI is valuable when it improves a real process. A summarizer no one reads, a chatbot that adds extra steps, or an agent that requires constant correction may reduce productivity rather than improve it. Good builders observe the work, identify bottlenecks, and design AI support around real behavior.

### Employment outlook and risks

AI application development has strong short-term demand because many organizations want to adopt AI quickly but do not have enough people who can turn models into working systems. McKinsey’s 2025 survey shows that AI use is already widespread, but most organizations are still early in scaling it across the enterprise. This creates demand for people who can bridge the gap between experiments and production.

The broader software labor market is also favorable. BLS projects overall employment of software developers, QA analysts, and testers to grow 15% from 2024 to 2034, with about 129,200 openings per year, and specifically cites continued expansion of software development for AI, IoT, robotics, and automation as a driver of strong demand. AI application development sits inside this broader software category rather than in a clean standalone occupation.

But the field is also crowded and unstable. Because model APIs are easy to call, many people can build simple AI demos. The low end of the field—prompt wrappers, basic chatbots, thin document Q&A tools, and generic agents—is weakly defensible. Many products will be copied, absorbed into larger platforms, or made obsolete by model-provider features.

The stronger opportunities are in production AI: systems that handle permissions, workflow integration, evaluation, observability, compliance, cost control, and domain-specific use cases. Enterprise AI adoption requires more than a clever prompt. McKinsey reports that high-performing organizations connect AI value to management practices across strategy, talent, operating model, technology, data, and adoption, and that agile delivery, technology infrastructure, and data infrastructure are correlated with value from AI. This favors practitioners who understand software, data, and organizations—not only model behavior.

AI also changes software work itself. Stack Overflow’s 2025 Developer Survey reports that 84% of respondents are using or planning to use AI tools in development, and 51% of professional developers use them daily. But the same survey says more developers distrust AI accuracy than trust it, and only a small fraction highly trust AI output. That is a warning for this field: AI application builders must be more skeptical than ordinary users, because they are responsible for systems that other people will trust.

Entry-level candidates face a specific problem: it is easy to build something that looks impressive, but harder to prove engineering depth. A strong portfolio should show more than a chat UI. It should include retrieval quality, permissions, evaluation results, failure cases, monitoring, cost estimates, fallback behavior, and clear explanation of tradeoffs. The ability to explain why the system fails is often more valuable than a polished demo that hides failures.

The long-term risk is that “AI application developer” becomes a vague label. The durable career paths will likely specialize: AI product engineer, RAG engineer, AI platform engineer, evaluation engineer, workflow automation engineer, domain AI engineer, or full-stack engineer with strong AI integration ability. The less durable path is being someone who only knows how to connect a model API to a frontend.

AI 应用开发，是把 AI 模型转化为可用产品的工作。它的主要任务不是从零发明一个新模型，而是把已有模型、数据、工具、界面和工作流组合起来，做成人们真正能使用的东西。

一个简单的 AI 演示，可能只是让模型在聊天框里回答一个问题。但真正的 AI 应用要做得更多。它必须知道自己允许使用哪些数据，什么时候需要搜索，什么时候需要调用工具，如何处理错误答案，如何保护隐私信息，如何呈现不确定性，如何衡量质量，如何控制成本，以及如何嵌入真实的工作流程。

这个领域位于软件工程、产品设计、数据工程、机器学习和业务运营之间。它是软件开发者最容易进入的 AI 相关领域之一，但也很容易被误解。难点不是让模型生成文字，而是让一个 AI 系统变得有用、可靠、安全，并且值得长期维护。

### 这个领域是如何发展起来的

在大语言模型广泛可用之前，大多数 AI 产品都需要专门的机器学习工作。团队通常需要收集数据、训练模型、评估模型、部署模型并持续维护。这一过程成本高、速度慢。AI 已经出现在推荐系统、搜索排序、欺诈检测、图像识别、语音识别、翻译和企业预测系统中，但构建这些系统通常需要专门的机器学习能力。

强大的通用语言模型发布之后，进入门槛发生了变化。开发者可以调用 API，并很快做出摘要、问答、写作辅助、代码辅助、数据抽取、翻译、客服、搜索和工作流自动化工具。这让 AI 应用开发看起来很像普通软件开发：调用模型，连接数据库，构建界面，然后部署。

第一波浪潮产生了大量演示，但也暴露了真正的问题。模型会产生幻觉。它们可能自信地给出错误答案。它们可能忽略指令。如果设计不当，它们可能泄露敏感数据。高频使用时，它们可能变得昂贵。它们可能在示例中表现良好，却在边界情况中失败。它们可能适合单个用户，却不适合一个需要权限、审计和合规要求的团队。

下一阶段是检索增强生成，通常称为 RAG。它不是让模型只依赖自身内部记忆回答问题，而是让应用从知识库中检索相关文档，并把这些文档作为上下文提供给模型。这使企业 AI 应用变得更可行：公司可以把模型连接到手册、政策、工单、合同、报告、产品文档或客户记录上。但 RAG 并没有消除真正的难题。搜索质量、切分方式、权限控制、文档新鲜度、引用准确性、评估和用户信任，都变成了工程问题。

当前阶段是智能体式 AI 和工作流集成。在这些系统中，模型可能会调用工具、规划步骤、搜索数据库、编写代码、更新记录、创建工单，或与其他软件交互。麦肯锡 2025 年全球 AI 调查显示，近九成受访者表示其组织经常使用 AI，62% 表示其组织至少正在尝试 AI 智能体；不过，近三分之二的组织尚未开始在企业范围内扩展 AI。该调查还强调，重新设计工作流是从 AI 中获取价值的关键因素。这正是该领域的核心现实：AI 采用已经相当普遍，但要让它在组织规模上真正运转起来，仍然很困难。

### 这个行业如何运作

AI 应用工作出现在几类不同组织中。

在创业公司中，AI 应用往往就是产品本身。一家创业公司可能会构建 AI 客服工具、法律研究助手、代码智能体、销售助手、写作工具、会议助手、数据分析助手、招聘工具、设计工具，或面向特定行业的工作流产品。这类公司行动很快，高度依赖 API、开源模型、向量数据库、提示设计、评估脚本和快速产品迭代。风险在于，如果产品只是模型外面的一层薄封装，就很容易被复制。持久价值通常来自工作流深度、专有数据访问、分发渠道、信任、集成能力，或特定用户群体。

在大型科技公司中，AI 应用团队通常是在已有产品里构建 AI 功能。搜索、办公软件、开发者工具、云平台、客服系统、分析工具、CRM 产品和设计软件，都在加入 AI 功能。这些团队必须把 AI 集成到成熟系统中，而这些系统已经有现有用户、权限体系、性能预期、可靠性标准和商业模式。这项工作没有演示那么光鲜，但更现实：AI 必须与旧代码、旧数据和旧用户习惯共存。

在传统企业中，AI 应用工作通常从内部生产力场景开始：知识搜索、文档摘要、客服辅助、合同审查、报告起草、内部帮助台、合规支持和工作流自动化。主要障碍很少只是模型质量。更常见的问题是数据访问、隐私、安全、员工采纳、审批流程、与旧系统集成，以及所有权不清。一个工具可能在技术上能运行，但如果不符合人们真实工作的方式，就会在组织层面失败。

在咨询公司和解决方案供应商中，团队为客户构建 AI 应用。这类工作可能包括概念验证演示、内部 Copilot、RAG 系统、数据准备、工作流自动化、模型选择、治理和部署。优势是可以接触不同产业。风险是实现过浅：客户可能想要一个快速 AI 演示，却没有解决决定系统能否长期存在的深层数据和工作流问题。

在 AI 平台公司中，工作更接近基础设施。团队构建模型托管、提示管理、评估、可观测性、向量搜索、护栏、监控、微调、智能体编排和成本控制工具。这些产品服务于其他 AI 构建者。这一部分领域需要更强的工程深度，因为客户是面对生产问题的技术团队。

### 不同角色分别贡献什么

**AI 应用开发者**构建面向用户的 AI 功能。这可能包括聊天界面、文档助手、摘要器、工作流工具、抽取系统、推荐助手或内部 Copilot。这个角色的价值在于把模型变成产品，使其能够处理真实输入、真实用户、错误、延迟、权限和成本。

**LLM 应用工程师**更专门地处理大语言模型。这个角色设计提示、工具调用、结构化输出、检索流程、记忆、模型路由和回退行为。薄弱的 LLM 应用工程师只会写提示词。强的工程师理解失败模式：幻觉、上下文丢失、无关检索、提示注入、输出格式错误、成本激增和评估缺口。

**RAG 工程师**构建结合搜索与生成的系统。这个角色处理文档摄取、切分、嵌入、向量数据库、重排序、元数据过滤、权限、引用处理和答案评估。它的价值不是“把文档接到聊天机器人上”，而是让系统检索正确证据，在证据薄弱时拒绝回答，并尊重谁有权看到什么。

**AI 产品工程师**在产品和工程之间工作。这个角色会判断是否应该使用 AI，AI 应该放在用户旅程的哪个位置，用户应该看到什么，需要什么控制权，哪些错误可以接受，以及成功应该如何衡量。优秀的 AI 产品工程师知道，不是每个工作流都应该变成聊天机器人。

**AI 评估工程师**设计方法来衡量 AI 系统是否有效。这可能包括测试集、人工审查、自动评分、回归测试、对抗样本、质量评分标准、延迟跟踪、成本指标和生产监控。这个角色正在变得更重要，因为 AI 系统没有简单的通过 / 失败结果。它们可能正确、部分正确、具有误导性、不安全，或者尽管有缺陷但仍然有用。

**AI 工作流工程师**把 AI 集成进业务流程。这可能包括把模型连接到工单系统、CRM、文档库、数据仓库、代码仓库、邮件、日历、内部工具或审批流程中。这个角色既需要理解软件集成，也需要理解人们实际如何工作。许多 AI 项目失败，是因为它们孤立来看很惊艳，但放进真实工作流里却很别扭。

**AI 平台工程师**为 AI 团队构建共享基础设施。这可能包括模型网关、认证、日志、提示版本管理、评估流水线、可观测性、成本控制、部署系统和治理工具。这个角色常见于拥有许多 AI 使用场景、需要共同基础而不是一次性原型的组织。

**提示工程师**作为独立角色，并不像这个名称暗示的那样稳定。提示是一项真实技能，但多数公司不太可能长期围绕“写提示词”建立团队。这个角色更持久的版本更宽：理解模型、产品行为、评估、结构化输出、工具使用、检索和用户工作流的人。

**领域 AI 专家**把 AI 应用能力与特定领域知识结合起来，比如法律、医学、金融、教育、物流、客服、软件开发或科学研究。这个角色很重要，因为当构建者不了解他们试图辅助的工作时，AI 系统往往会失败。领域知识有助于定义什么是好答案、什么错误不可接受，以及什么工作流真正有用。

### 从业者需要变得擅长什么

第一项能力是软件交付。AI 应用仍然是软件。它们需要界面、API、数据库、认证、日志、测试、部署、监控和维护。一个只会调用模型 API 的人，无法构建严肃的 AI 产品。模型周围的应用层，往往决定了系统是否有用。

第二项能力是理解模型限制。模型可以听起来正确但实际上错误。它们可能在某个案例中遵循指令，却在另一个案例中失败。它们可能难以处理长上下文、隐藏假设、罕见事实、算术、引用、工具使用或含糊的用户请求。优秀的 AI 应用开发者不会把模型输出当作真理。他们会设计系统来检查、约束、检索、验证或升级处理。

第三项能力是评估。这是该领域最重要的技能之一。如果没有人能够衡量质量，AI 系统就很难改进。开发者需要创建测试案例，比较模型版本，追踪失败，衡量检索质量，检查幻觉，监控用户满意度，并决定什么错误水平可以接受。没有评估，团队只是在猜。

第四项能力是数据和检索判断。许多 AI 应用依赖公司文档、知识库、工单、代码、政策或客户记录。如果数据过时、重复、格式混乱、切分不当或权限设置错误，AI 系统就会不可靠。模型可能收到错误上下文，然后生成一个写得很漂亮但错误的答案。RAG 工作往往更多是数据质量和搜索问题，而不是提示词问题。

第五项能力是产品判断。好的 AI 功能会给用户控制权。它应该明确说明自己能做什么，使用了什么证据，什么时候不确定，以及用户如何纠正它。许多糟糕的 AI 产品失败，是因为它们要求用户信任太多。更好的产品会在后果重要的地方让人参与其中。

第六项能力是安全和隐私意识。AI 应用经常连接敏感数据和工具。粗心的设计可能暴露私人文档，让用户访问他们不应看到的信息，或让提示注入操纵工具调用。开发者需要从一开始就思考权限、数据留存、日志、密钥、用户身份、审计轨迹和滥用场景。

第七项能力是成本和延迟控制。AI 调用不是免费的，响应过慢也会损害产品体验。开发者需要理解 token 用量、缓存、模型选择、批处理、流式输出、回退模型、速率限制，以及什么时候更小或更便宜的模型已经足够。演示可以忽略成本；生产产品不能。

第八项能力是理解工作流。AI 的价值在于改善真实流程。一个没人阅读的摘要器、一个增加额外步骤的聊天机器人，或一个需要不断纠正的智能体，可能不是提升效率，而是降低效率。好的构建者会观察工作本身，识别瓶颈，并围绕真实行为设计 AI 支持。

### 就业前景与风险

AI 应用开发有较强的短期需求，因为许多组织想快速采用 AI，却没有足够的人能把模型转化为可工作的系统。麦肯锡 2025 年调查显示，AI 使用已经相当普遍，但多数组织在企业范围内扩展 AI 方面仍处于早期阶段。这为能够连接实验与生产的人创造了需求。

更广泛的软件劳动力市场也比较有利。美国劳工统计局预计，2024 至 2034 年，软件开发者、软件 QA 分析师和测试人员的整体就业将增长 15%，每年约有 129,200 个职位空缺，并特别指出，AI、IoT、机器人和自动化软件开发的持续扩张，是强劲需求的驱动因素之一。AI 应用开发属于这一更广泛的软件类别，而不是一个清晰独立的职业类别。

但这个领域也很拥挤且不稳定。由于模型 API 很容易调用，许多人都能构建简单的 AI 演示。该领域的低端部分——提示词封装器、基础聊天机器人、薄层文档问答工具和通用智能体——防御性较弱。许多产品会被复制，被更大平台吸收，或被模型提供商的新功能淘汰。

更强的机会在生产级 AI：能够处理权限、工作流集成、评估、可观测性、合规、成本控制和领域特定场景的系统。企业 AI 采用需要的不只是一个聪明提示词。麦肯锡报告称，表现优秀的组织会把 AI 价值与战略、人才、运营模式、技术、数据和采用方式等管理实践连接起来；敏捷交付、技术基础设施和数据基础设施，也与 AI 价值获取相关。这有利于那些理解软件、数据和组织的人，而不只是理解模型行为的人。

AI 也在改变软件工作本身。Stack Overflow 2025 年开发者调查显示，84% 的受访者正在使用或计划在开发过程中使用 AI 工具，51% 的专业开发者每天使用 AI 工具。但同一调查也显示，对 AI 准确性持不信任态度的开发者多于信任者，只有很小一部分人高度信任 AI 输出。对这个领域来说，这是一个警示：AI 应用构建者必须比普通用户更怀疑，因为他们要为别人会信任的系统负责。

入门级候选人会面临一个特定问题：做出看起来惊艳的东西很容易，证明工程深度却更难。强作品集应该展示的不只是聊天界面。它应该包括检索质量、权限、评估结果、失败案例、监控、成本估算、回退行为，以及对取舍的清楚说明。能够解释系统为什么失败，往往比一个隐藏失败的精致演示更有价值。

长期风险在于，“AI 应用开发者”可能变成一个模糊标签。更持久的职业路径很可能会分化：AI 产品工程师、RAG 工程师、AI 平台工程师、评估工程师、工作流自动化工程师、领域 AI 工程师，或具备强 AI 集成能力的全栈工程师。较不持久的路径，是只知道如何把模型 API 接到前端的人。
